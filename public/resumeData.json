    "bio":"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a technique that allows the identification of objects which instances have not been seen during training. By describing the unseen classes using examples the model is familiar with we can leverage the understanding to produce accurate predictions of objects the model has never seen. This technique arose in 2008 under the paradigm dataless classification, but more recently, the availability of meta-information has increased significantly, giving rise to a new wave of zero-shot enthusiasm.  Multi-label zero-shot learning (MLZSL) is a facet of zero-shot learning in which an image is labelled with multiple labels instead of just one. Most images typically do not just contain one object so this technique lends itself to a wider range of applications than traditional ZSL. ",
